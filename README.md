Assess the feasibility of using NIR spectroscopy to measure a critical quality component of a wood product


In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a guidance to encourage innovation in pharmaceutical development, manufacturing and quality assurance. 
The framework, called Process Analytical Technology (PAT), combines MultiVariate Data Analysis (MVDA), Design of Experiments (DoE) and process analytical chemistry methods such as UV, IR, NIR, NMR (fast, precise, online and preferably non-invasive methods). 
Here, we use PCA and PLS, two classic MVDA approaches to assess the feasibility of using NIR to measure a critical quality component of a wood product, the composition of wood fiber. In the first part, we will perform unsupervised data exploration with PCA. In the second part, we will run PLS, a supervised learning algorithm, to quantify the outputs of interest (i.e. wood composition).

Key tasks:
1. Visualize the raw NIR training data points (for different wavelenghts)
2. Use PCA to promote feature selection and identify necessary data
3. Visualize PC1 & PC2 of train & test data to verify similar variance
4. Create a PLS Regression model using training data
5. Predict the output for the test data
6. Compare the results with the actual data

Results:
NIR SPECTROSCOPY CAN BE USED TO MEASURE THE COMPOSITION OF THE WOOD FIBER
